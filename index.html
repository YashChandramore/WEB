            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">
                Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values,
                morals, beliefs, habits, and personal development.[1] Education originated as transmission of cultural
                heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals increasingly encompass new ideas such
                as liberation of learners, critical thinking about presented information, skills needed for the modern
                society, empathy and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">
                
                The history of Indian Cinema goes back to the nineteenth century. In 1896, the very first films shot by the Lumiere Brothers were shown in Mumbai (then Bombay).

But history was actually created when Harishchandra Sakharam Bhatavdekar popularly known as Save Dada, the still photographer, was so much influenced by the Lumiere Brothers’ production that he ordered a camera from England. His first film was shot at the Hanging Gardens in Mumbai, known as ‘The Wrestlers’. It was a simple recording of a wrestling match which was screened in 1899 and is considered as the first motion picture in the Indian Film Industry.

                One of the best and most obvious advantages to playing sports is the exercise that you get from athletic activity. The benefits of exercise include improved heart health, weight loss, lower blood pressure and reduced body fat. 

Most sports require physical conditioning, so you can see the benefits of exercise as you prepare for playing. You’ll also see benefits from the physical activity of the sport itself.
