Virat Kohli is the leading run-scorer in the history of the Indian Premier League (IPL) and one of the biggest names in the tournament. However, he never shies away from crediting the league for how it helped him develop as a player. Ahead of Royal Challengers Bangalore's clash against Chennai Super Kings on Wednesday, the star revealed "the most important thing" about the league that helped improve his game. He said that the fact that the IPL let him compete against and share knowledge with the best players.

"Like so many other people, IPL has had a big influence and impact in my life. I think outside of playing for India, IPL gave me the platform to show my capabilities, compete against the best in the world and share knowledge with them," Kohli said while speaking on RCB's show on Star Sports.
