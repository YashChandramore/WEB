                Reading knows no age. This is not a philosopher or an education pontificating. Babita Devi, in her 30s and a student of Class II, is the proud announcer. Devi, married off by her impoverished family at 16, is now learning the joy of reading at Day Time Secondary School in Kidwai Nagar East.
                “Even as a child, I wanted to read and write, especially the bhajan and aarti books. But after marriage and children, I gave up all hope,” said Devi. “When my children grew up and didn’t have time to recite the aarti for me, I thought long and hard about whether I would remain illiterate all my life." Last year, Devi got herself enrolled in Class I.
                Like her, 65 others aged 15-20 years and three above 20 are attending classes alongside younger students at Day Time School. In 1990-91, according to teacher Suita Sharma, the then school’s director wished to provide educational facilities to dropouts and adult women who hadn’t had the opportunity to educate themselves because of family circumstances. The school conducts a test to assess the aptitude of the women and girls and enrol them in different classes.
