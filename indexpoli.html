            <p class="sectionSubtag text-small">
                Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Thursday chaired a meeting to review heatwave management and monsoon preparedness. Several parts of the country have been reeling under an intense heatwave for the past few weeks with temperatures soaring to an all-time time high in several places. Average maximum temperatures reached 35.9 and 37.78 degrees Celsius in the northwest and central India respectively with both the regions of the country experiencing the hottest April in 122 years. A hailstorm and rainfall lashed parts of Delhi on Wednesday bringing much-needed relief from the unrelenting heat.

The heatwave is likely to return after May 7 as per the predictions of a senior scientist at India Meteorological Department (IMD), RK Jenamani. Heatwaves are common in India in the spring and early summer, especially in May, which is typically the hottest month. But they are often relieved by the onset of the monsoon season from late May through September.
